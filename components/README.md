# Welcome to SUI

SUI is an open-source, high-quality library of reusable React components that empower teams to craft any product with ease.

## Declarative approach:

SUI is Declarative, Intuitive, Consistent and Product-agnostic. Every component should allow its customisation through React Props.

If you need to add or adjust any of the following for a component, you can send a PR directly without previous notice.

- Font sizes, colour and weight
- Border visibility, size and colour
- Border radius
- Box-Shadow style
- Background colour
- Paddings and Margins
- Icon and icon colour
