### FormTextarea

Basic text-area form element.

A placeholder to specify a short hint of the expected value of the text area (which will be displayed only when the text-area is empty) can be passed in ```placeholder``` property.

The default height and width of the text area can be defined whether with ```cols``` and ```rows``` property, or with a custom CSS class name.

The spellcheck of the inner text of the text area can be disabled (HTML5).

You can pass a custom callback to be executed when the text area value is changed, through ```onChange``` property.
