### FormCheckbox

Simple checkbox form element.

You can pass a custom callback to be executed when the checkbox value is changed, through `onChange` property.

Despite it has default icons to represent the states of the checkbox, it allows their customization (for checked/unchecked states) through `svgIcons.checked` and `svgIcons.unchecked` properties.

It also supports to display an error message, if the component's property `errorMessage` is set.
