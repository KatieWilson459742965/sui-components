## Type

The Upload is defined as an elastic component that is responsive to the needs. It raises two states, active state and state of charge. This makes a component required to create feedback to the user of what is happening in the upload process.

## Behavior

Once the user has dragged the file, it will show the spinner component that will inform the user that it is in the process of uploading and when the process finishes we will let you know that it has been a success
