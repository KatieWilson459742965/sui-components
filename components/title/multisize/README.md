### TitleMultisize

#### Provides a title with 3 different sizes on the same line.
Useful when we intend to have a main title with a word that must be highlighted having a bigger font size.

This component is built using the structure:

````html
<h3>pre-title</h3><h1>TITLE</h1><h3>post-title</h3>
````
where first and last part of title (both H3 HTML tags) are optional.
