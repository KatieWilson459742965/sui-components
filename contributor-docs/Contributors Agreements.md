# Contributors Agreements

- Specs: We add feedback to Design Proposals and Specs in form of comments in Figma
- Discussions: We record are latest agreements in the comments section of the proposal
- We don't automatically assume all blockers are urgent. We prioritise them in accordance to their severity
- We always update the Figma UI Kits after the rollouts 
- We value certainty when making decisions: In the case of uncertainty, we plan a Spike and minimise risks.
- We use data and learnings from previous experience (speed, capacity, blockers, etc)
- We close each issue after fixing the reported bug, defect or issue
- We communicate blockers as soon as possible (slack and Weekly Syncs are perfect forums for it)
- We avoid scope and design changes during the development of a component or iteration
- We communicate the resolutions of all issues proactivelly
- We document all our processes and agreements under [contribution-docs](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui-components/contributor-docs/)
- If we are forced to publish something with bugs or defects, we make sure they are properly documented
