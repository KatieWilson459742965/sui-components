# Implementation

- Engineer just enough of a solution, value declarative over abstraction
- A little verbosity is better than clever code. Avoid implementations that reduce the ability for people to contribute
- Automate and abstract when repetition is a hindrance
- Seek feedback on implementations as often as possible
- Everything is a component
- Provide flexibility, but within the boundaries of our agreeements
- Assume that people will break the rules, and provide safe ways for them to do so
