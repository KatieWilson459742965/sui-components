# Innovation

- Treat everything as an experiment. Make small incremental steps that provide proof towards goals, or disprove them.
- Ship often. We learn more from tangible outcomes than something that only lives as an idea.
- Work on reducing complexity and simplifying solutions to enable us to innovate faster.
