# Comunication

SUI Components provides a share vocabulary between design and engineering, the language we use should be correct but not at the expense of providing clarity. Use words and descriptions that both designers and engineers can understand.

- Be a bridge not a barrier. Use vocabulary that provides meaning to both designers and engineers
- Choose language that provides mutual understanding between engineering and design over specificity
- Support new vocabulary with descriptions and examples
- Be consistent in the application of vocabulary in written and verbal communication to reinforce understandings
- Articulate what you are aiming to achieve as well as what you are not doing
