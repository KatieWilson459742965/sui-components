# Judgment

There's often more than one way to do things, and there aren't always best-practice examples to follow. Despite this we still need to make decisions and keep moving forward. To deal with an uncertain future and still move forward we should have strong opinions, weakly held

- Make decisions that move us forward rather than halting progress due to ambiguity or difference of opinion
- Make decisions based on long term goals rather than this week's ship
- Evaluate technology by the risk they present, not just the solution they offer. High risk deserves careful consideration, low risk deserves less attention
- Have opinions and arguments for them, but remain open to seeing and hearing evidence that clashes with them when those opinions become wrong
- Prioritize solutions for people who use SUI Components and how it serves the customers who use products built with SUI Components
- Seek feedback on code review often, and more often when a solution takes you down a new path
- Take time to provide good code review, encompassing the above values when providing feedback
